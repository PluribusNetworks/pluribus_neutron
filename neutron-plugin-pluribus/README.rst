OpenStack Neutron Pluribus Plugin
======

1. Introduction
------
Pluribus Networks (http://www.pluribusnetworks.com) was founded in April 2010 by Sunay Tripathi, Robert Drost, and C.K. Ken Yang to deliver server economics, innovation, and programmability to top of the rack switching. With over 50 years of experience and more than 200 patents collectively, the founders brought hard-core expertise in network operating systems, virtualization, and high-performance hardware-software integration. Using Sunay's background in network virtualization and kernel development, Robert's background in proximity communication, and Ken's authority on high speed serial links, the founding team had all the ingredients needed to tightly integrate a server and switch running a bare metal, distributed network hypervisor (NetvisorÂ®).

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

This project hosts the Pluribus Networks plugin for OpenStack Neutron. 

2. Requirements
------
* OpenStack Havana or Icehouse controller
* Pluribus Networks server-switch underneath

3. Installation
------
To install the plugin:

1. Download and extract the plugin.
2. Navigate to the previously extracted directory.
3. Run:
  $ python setup.py install
4. Edit /etc/neutron/neutron.conf to set the core_plugin to the Pluribus plugin:
  core_plugin = neutron.plugins.pluribus.plugin.PluribusDecompPluginV2
5. Restart the Neutron server:
  $ service neutron-server restart
